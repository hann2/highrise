# Management Stuff

Send a party for a run.
As you climb the tower, you gain survivors. Maybe 40 or so for the entire game (not distributed evenly across floors).
Survivors collect in your base on the bottom level.
Survivors consume food, water, & fuel. Collect these resources as you climb.
Running out of these can affect health & morale.
As survivors “die” during runs, they get sent down to base with a zombie bite. Can attempt to amputate, but may remain infected regardless.
Making progress gains morale.
Amputation hurts morale a little.
Losing survivors hurts morale.
Watching survivors turn hurts morale more.
Killing survivors who are about to turn hurts morale even more.
Running out of morale loses the game. Survivors will open front doors and be immediately overrun.
