Sprites to Fix in order of amount they bother me most:

- Bookshelfs
- Boxes
- Shop tables
- Lobby chairs
- lobby tables
- piano
- health pack (sorry Philip)



Other gameplay things that bother me
- Bullets hit furniture
- goo/blood goes under rug
- I want mute settings to be remembered on refresh


Ally AI Ideas
- Make AI a state machine
- Run away when zombies are too close
- Pick up better guns when they see them
- Call out health packs when they see them


Ideas for performance improvements
- Separate custom broadphase system for shadows
- Make walls use lines instead of boxes (at least for shadows)
- A* for AI
- Somehow make raycasting fast, then use it for shadows and AI


Code cleanliness things that bug me
- Lots of duplicated code in:
  - Enemies
  - Projectiles
