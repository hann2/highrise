Sprites to Fix in order of amount they bother me most:

- Shop tables
- Chad (I feel like his lines just aren't very distinct)


Other gameplay things that bother me
- AI Breaks on new level
- We get a bunch of the same sound playing on top of each other with zombies
- Melee weapons don't feel great
- Human collision detection doesn't match sprite
- Can't navigate menus with controller

Polish things to add:
- Highlight interactable objects, especially ones in range
- Sort character new level lines by things they say on the first level or when they're alone or something


Ally AI Ideas
- Make AI a state machine
- Push zombies when they're too close
- Pick up better guns when they see them
- Call out health packs when they see them


Ideas for performance improvements
- Separate custom broadphase system for shadows
- Make walls use lines instead of boxes (at least for shadows)
- A* for AI
- Somehow make raycasting fast, then use it for shadows and AI
- Allow setting resolution/antialiasing


Code cleanliness things that bug me
- Lots of duplicated code in:
  - Projectiles
  - Flesh/Goo/Blood/Impact stuff
